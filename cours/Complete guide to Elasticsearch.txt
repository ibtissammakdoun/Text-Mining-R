This online course is the most comprehensive Elasticsearch tutorial that you will find anywhere! It is a great starting point for anyone who wants to learn the Elastic Stack and ELK stack, as Elasticsearch is at the center of both stacks.
Elasticsearch is an extremely popular search engine and will be an excellent addition to your CV - even if you are already familiar with other search engines or frameworks such as Apache Lucene, Apache Solr, Algolia, etc.
This Elasticsearch course is a combination of theory and learning by doing. Before giving examples of how to perform certain queries, you will have been equipped with the necessary theory in advance. This ensures that you not only know how to write powerful Elasticsearch queries, but that you also understand the relevant theory. Throughout this tutorial, you will get a deep understanding of how Elasticsearch works under the hood.
The course starts from the absolute beginning, and no knowledge or prior experience with Elasticsearch is required. We will walk through all of the most important aspects of Elasticsearch. After completing this course, you will be able to utilize Elasticsearch for a number of use cases and purposes, such as:
Building a full text search engine (e.g. similar to Google Search)
Data analytics for large amounts of data with aggregations
Using Elasticsearch as a time series database (TSDB)
... and much more!
Combined with other products in the Elastic Stack, such as Logstash or Kibana, you will unlock several other features, such as:
Log management and log analysis
Observability (including server/service monitoring and APM (Application Performance Monitoring))
Data visualization and reporting
Security analysis (SIEM)
... and much more!
